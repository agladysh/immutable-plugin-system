[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-05

### Changed

- Removed optional top-level entity support; plugins must now provide every
  declared entity type and use empty maps to signal "no entities"
- Dropped the `requiredEntityTypes` runtime escape hatch; `ImmutableHost` and
  guard APIs enforce entity completeness unconditionally
- Strengthened runtime validation so the host throws when a plugin omits any
  declared entity type
- Updated documentation and examples to reflect deterministic entity discovery

### Fixed

- Prevented plugins with mismatched entity schemas from silently producing
  partial collections by failing fast during host construction

Implements Specification v1.3.0 (r1.3.0)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-26

### Added

- `ImmutableEntityCollection.size` property: Returns the number of unique keys
  in the collection
- `ImmutableEntityCollection.keys()` method: Returns an iterator over unique
  keys
- `ImmutableEntityCollection.values()` method: Returns an iterator over entity
  arrays per key
- Full Map-like API compatibility for `ImmutableEntityCollection`

Implements Specification v1.2.0 (r1.2.0)
